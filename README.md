# Bookmark Manager

# Task

You're going to build a bookmark manager. A bookmark manager is a website to maintain a collection of bookmarks (URLs). You can use it to save a webpage you found useful. You can add tags to the webpages you saved to find them later. You can browse bookmarks other users have added. You can comment on the bookmarks.

The website will have the following specification:

1.Show a list of bookmarks

2.Add new bookmarks

3.Delete bookmarks

4.Update bookmarks

5.Comment on bookmarks

6.Tag bookmarks into categories

7.Filter bookmarks by tag

8.Users are restricted to manage only their own bookmarks

# Approach
